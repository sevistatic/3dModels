These are some models that I am sure every metriod or nintendo fan has wanted!
There are two models included here, high poly and low poly. I accidentally
named them wrong. The Samus A file is the low poly and the Samus lows are the high poly.
The files are .3ds. 

WARNING! THESE ARE ONLY MODELS DO NOT PUT THEM IN YOUR TAGS FOLDER!!!!!!!

I really would like someone to animate these and then put them in your map. I just would
like some credit.

PS I will not be making a ball form of Samus.
