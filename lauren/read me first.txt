The lines that look like _ _ _ _ are called mountain lines.
You fold them down so that the crease forms a kind of peak.

The lines that look like _ . _ . are called valley lines.
You fold them up so the crease forms a sort of valley.

I use a blue pen and a red pen with a nice sharp edge, and before even cutting,
mark every valley line in blue, and every mountain line in red.
It makes it easier to see the lines and know which way to fold them,
plus making the mark into the cardstock makes it easier to crease.

Solid line are borders, and you should cut along these with an exacto knife.
You might see a tab pass underneath another part of the design.
Don't worry about that, you almost never need as much as they give you to glue the tabs together.

If a piece of the mask seems weak, you can use scrap cardstock as support on the inside where nobody will see.

Take the .bmp files to office depot and make sure you print it on the HEAVIEST card stock they have.
And black and white printing will save you money.  You can always spray paint it later.



I am including the .pdo file so you can open it in Pepakura Viewer and see where the folds connect,
if you get lost.

Be careful and don't burn or cut yourself.
