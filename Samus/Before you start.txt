Before building:

!! IMPORTANT !!

This is NOT a good craft for beginners.  I mean, you can try it if you want, but I would suggest that you try out a few easier models first before you try out this one.  Just save yourself the frustration (and the ink). ;)

I recommend that, before you start, you look over this document, the model, the instructions, etc..  It really helps to know what you're doing BEFORE you screw up. ^_^

To open files:

To open .PDF files, you will need Adobe Reader: http://www.adobe.com/products/reader/
To open .PDO files, you will need Pepakura Viewer: http://www.tamasoft.co.jp/pepakura-en/

What to print:

    I've included a lot of different files and stuff in here, so it may be confusing which one you should print.  It mostly depends on your style of building.

First of all: you should NOT print directly from the PDO file.  I've made a few changes that do not show up in the PDO, so you should only print from the PDF's.  The PDO is only for reference; if you aren't sure where a piece goes, you can check the PDO.

So which version do you want to print?  There are five different versions:

- Lineless
- Lined (Rounded)
- Lined (Sharp)
- Lined & White (Rounded)
- Lined & White (Sharp)

    Which ones you want to print will depend on how you want the model to look.  The Lineless version will produce a higher quality model, since you won't see fold marks on all the edges.
If you print the Lineless version, then you will also need to print out the Lined version or the Lined & White version as a guide, so you can see where to fold.
If you don't want to use a guide for the folds, then just print out the Lined version.
The "Rounded" files only have certain folds marked, and any angle more than 150 degrees is counted as flat.  This produces a smoother look.
The "Sharp" files have every fold marked, which produces a more polygonal look.

I hope that makes sense, I tried my best. :p

Materials you will need before you start:

- Glue
- Knife or precision scissors
- Scoring tool (Most people use a ballpoint pen that is out of ink)
- Ruler or straight edge
- Toothpick(s)

Other stuff that will make things easier:

- Paper towel
- Unfolded paper clips (either long and straight, or curved, to reach around corners)
- Tweezers
- Multi-tool
- Cutting mat

A note about the instructions:

    If you see a slight difference between the instructions and the real craft, it is because, while I was building the model, I realized that it wasn't perfect.  So, I fixed it to be easier to build.  For example, I have swapped a bunch of tabs on the body.  Even though they look different in the instructions, don't worry.  It just makes it easier for you.

Also, there were a few places in the instructions where you could see another template printed on the inside of the model.  That was my fault; I ran out of cardstock while I was building the model, so I had to "recycle" some old templates. ;)

--------------------

Order of building:

    The different sections of this craft can be built in any order, or all at a time.  I personally was building about 5 different sections at once, so I could save time.  By doing that, though, it makes it a lot easier to mix up pieces.  If you aren't in a rush, it may be safer to do only a few sections at once.
